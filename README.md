# Study of Various Machine Learning Algorithms Applied to the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Data Set

This is a group project for the Machine Learning and Data Mining (MLDM) course at the University of Brescia, for the academic year 2021/2022.

In this project we compare various machine learning algorithms for the classification of the [Online
Shoppers Purchasing Intention Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset).
The instances of the dataset are imbalanced, so special care is needed. 

We begin the study with a few basic classsifiers:
- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Naive Bayes

The we combine the basic classifiers through the following ensembles:
- Bagging
- Random Forest
- RUS
- EasyEnsemble
- XGBoost
- Voting Ensemble

We also built a basic neural network for the classification task.

Finally, we compare the results we obtained with those found by Autosklearn 2.0.
